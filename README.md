## Misc

### [ReAct - Reasoning and Action framework](https://medium.com/@jainashish.079/build-llm-agent-combining-reasoning-and-action-react-framework-using-langchain-379a89a7e881)

The ReAct framework combines reasoning and action planning to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling them to generate reasoning traces and task-specific actions. This approach addresses challenges like complex reasoning and error propagation by integrating Chain-of-Thought prompting with action planning. ReAct allows LLMs to iteratively process questions, execute external actions (such as API calls), and refine their reasoning until a solution is reached. LangChain, an open-source framework, facilitates building applications with ReAct by providing modular components and agents for task completion. This framework can be implemented using the ChatGPT model and LangChain tools for effective problem-solving.
